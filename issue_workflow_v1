Issue Workflow "Logic"

* Is issue also PR?
  - If yes: Do nothing, PR workflow overrules.
  - Otherwise: continue ahead

* Is issue type properly set?
  - If anything other than bug report, feature idea, or docs report,
        * Add needs_revision label
        * Apply please_complete boilerplate
  - If bug report, feature idea, or docs report, then: next

* Does issue reference a valid module in the correct repository?
  - If yes, then:
        * Add bug_report label, apply bug_report boilerplate, pinging maintainer; apply networking/windows/cloud labels as appropriate
        OR
        * Add docs_report label, apply docs_report boilerplate, pinging maintainer; apply networking/windows/cloud labels as appropriate
        OR
        * Add feature_idea label, apply feature_idea label, pinging maintainer; apply networking/windows/cloud labels as appropriate
  - If valid module, wrong repository:
        * Add pending_action label, other_repository boilerplate
        * Close in 2 weeks or whatever the pending_action time frame is
  - If not a current module:
        * Add needs_revision label, apply cant_find_module boilerplate

* After maintainer ping / label:
  - If issue is tagged by maintainer as needs_info:
        * Add needs_info label
        * Apply needs_info boilerplate
        * Ping submitter

* If docs report or bugs report, and maintainer does not respond within 30 days:
   - Apply friendly_reminder boilerplate
* If docs report, bug report, or feature idea, and maintainer requests needs_info:
   - Apply needs_info label
   - Apply generic needs_info boilerplate, pinging submitter
* If docs report, bug report, or feature idea, and 30 days since needs_info label was applied:
   - Apply pending_action label
   - Apply pending_action boilerplate

* If docs_report, bug_report, or feature_idea, and pending_action for more than two weeks:
   - Close issue
   - Apply closing_non_responsive boilerplate.

"@maintainer: Pinging you with a friendly reminder that this bug report exists. We know you're human (unlike Ansibullbot!) - but:

2: If you believe this issue has been or will be resolved by an existing pull request, please indicate (??)
3: Sometimes life or work can get busy! While we don't need to know all the details, just let us know you're busy for a while in a comment. People understand. (And really: if you're on a vacation, we are super happy for you -- but don't tell us the dates when you'll be out of town. Creepy people on the internet might go to your house and take all your Ansible stickers if they know you're gone.)"
