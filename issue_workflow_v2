Issue Workflow

-- Assumptions --
  * Triagebot should be able to determine if module is in either repository, and redirect to appropriate repository (depending on what repository it is running against, I guess?) 

-- Logic --
Goal of this logic is mostly to encourage a dialogue between submitter and maintainer via friendly reminders. 

IF:
* Is an issue (not a PR)
* Issue_type is properly set for correct repository
* Module name is properly referenced and issue is in correct repository

THEN: Notify maintainer.

NEXT:
  IF: 
    * Maintainer does not respond within 30 days: apply maintainer_friendly_reminder
    * Maintainer responds with needs_info: apply needs_info boilerplate
  
NEXT:
IF: Submitter responds after needs_info label: remove needs_info. 

NEXT:
2 weeks since maintainer_reminder or needs_info: Ping maintainer and submitter with friendly_reminder. Keep doing this until endoftime.

-- Workflow -- 
* Is issue also PR?
  - If yes: Do nothing, PR workflow overrules.
  - Otherwise: continue ahead

* Is issue type properly set?
  - If anything other than bug report, feature idea, or docs report,
    * Add needs_revision label
    * Apply please_complete boilerplate
  - If issue type is properly set to bug report, feature idea, or docs report, then: next

* Does issue reference a valid module in the correct repository?
  - If yes, then:
    * Add bug_report label, apply bug_report boilerplate, pinging maintainer; apply networking/windows/cloud labels as appropriate
      OR
    * Add docs_report label, apply docs_report boilerplate, pinging maintainer; apply networking/windows/cloud labels as appropriate
      OR
    * Add feature_idea label, apply feature_idea label, pinging maintainer; apply networking/windows/cloud labels as appropriate
  - If valid module, wrong repository:
    * Add pending_action label (NOT BOILERPLATE), apply other_repository_(extras)(core) boilerplate
    * Auto-close after two weeks (assumption is that they are either (a) not responsive, (b) opened module in correct repository)
  - If not currently a module:
    * Add needs_revision label, apply please_complete boilerplate

* If issue labeled is labeled needs_revision for more than 2 weeks, and only 1 comment (original) in issue from submitter: Apply pending_action boilerplate
  - Handles "none or wrong issue type" and "not a current module" scenarios
* If issue is pending_action for more than 2 weeks, and only 1 comment (original) in issue from submitter: Close issue, apply closing_non_responsive boilerplate.
* If issue is updated with module name, then proceed with above steps for "issue references valid module in correct repository."

* After maintainer ping with bug_report, docs_report, or feature_idea label:
  - If issue is tagged by maintainer as needs_info:
    * Add needs_info label
    * Apply needs_info boilerplate
    * Ping submitter
  - Or: After 30 days since maintainer ping and no response from maintainer: apply maintain_reminder boilerplate

* If submitter responds after needs_info label was added: remove needs_info label
  
* If 2 weeks since maintainer_reminder was applied or needs_info was applied: apply friendly_reminder label

At any time: 
  - If issue is tagged by maintainer as bug_resolved:
    * Apply bug_resolved boilerplate
  - If issue is tagged by submitter as bug_resolved:
    * Apply bug_resolved_submitter boilerplate
      
* If at any time a pull request is referenced in the issue (NOTE: This could be optional / future enhancement, but might help people to be more proactive about testing PRs / closing issues.)
  - If pull request was referenced by issue submitter:
    * Apply submitter_PR boilerplate, ping maintainer
  - If pull request was referenced by a maintainer:
    * Apply maintainer_PR boilerplate, ping submitter
  - If pull request was referenced by anyone else:
    * Apply other_PR boilerplate, ping submitter and maintainer
  OR:
    - If all that logic is too hard:
    - If a pull request was referenced by anyone: apply pull_request_created boilerplate

* If docs report or bugs report, and maintainer does not respond within 30 days:
  - Apply maintainer_reminder boilerplate; ping both maintainer and submitter

* If docs report, bug report, or feature idea, and maintainer requests needs_info:
  - Apply needs_info label
  - Apply needs_info boilerplate, pinging submitter

"@maintainer: Pinging you with a friendly reminder that this bug report exists. We know you're human (unlike Ansibullbot!) - but:
1: If you're just seeing this for the first time, and it needs more information, please leave a comment saying needs_info and any additional questions you might have for the submitter.

3: Sometimes life or work can get busy! While we don't need to know all the details, just let us know you're busy for a while in a comment. People understand. (And really: if you're on a vacation, we are super happy for you -- but don't tell us the dates when you'll be out of town. Creepy people on the internet might go to your house and take all your Ansible stickers if they know you're gone.)"
