Issue Workflow

-- Assumptions --
  * Triagebot should be able to determine if module is in either repository, and redirect to appropriate repository (depending on what repository it is running against, I guess?) 

-- Logic --
Goal of this logic is mostly to encourage a dialogue between submitter and maintainer via friendly reminders. 

IF:
* Is an issue (not a PR)
* Issue_type is properly set for correct repository
* Module name is properly referenced and issue is in correct repository

THEN: Notify maintainer. Add in_progress label. Apply (docs)(bug)(feature)boilerplate.

NEXT:
  IF: 
    * Maintainer does not respond within 2 weeks: apply maintainer_friendly_reminder
    
  ELSE:
    * If no comments from submitter or maintainer in past two weeks: apply periodic_reminder. Keep doing until end of time / resolution.
  
-- Workflow -- 
* Is issue also PR?
  - If yes: Do nothing, PR workflow overrules.
  - Otherwise: continue ahead

* Is issue type properly set?
  - If anything other than bug report, feature idea, or docs report,
    * Add needs_revision label
    * Apply please_complete boilerplate
  - If issue type is properly set to bug report, feature idea, or docs report, then: next

* Does issue reference a valid module in the correct repository?
  - If yes, then:
    * Add bug_report label, apply bug_report boilerplate, pinging maintainer; apply networking/windows/cloud labels as appropriate
      OR
    * Add docs_report label, apply docs_report boilerplate, pinging maintainer; apply networking/windows/cloud labels as appropriate
      OR
    * Add feature_idea label, apply feature_idea label, pinging maintainer; apply networking/windows/cloud labels as appropriate
  - If valid module, wrong repository:
    * Add pending_action label (NOT BOILERPLATE), apply other_repository_(extras)(core) boilerplate
    * Auto-close after two weeks (assumption is that they are either (a) not responsive, (b) opened module in correct repository)
  - If not currently a module:
    * Add needs_revision label, apply please_complete boilerplate

* If issue labeled is labeled needs_revision for more than 2 weeks, and only 1 comment (original) in issue from submitter: Apply pending_action boilerplate
  - Handles "none or wrong issue type" and "not a current module" scenarios
* If issue is pending_action for more than 2 weeks, and only 1 comment (original) in issue from submitter: Close issue, apply closing_non_responsive boilerplate.
* If issue is updated with module name, then proceed with above steps for "issue references valid module in correct repository."

* After maintainer/submitter ping with bug_report, docs_report, or feature_idea label:
  
  - If: 2 weeks since original maintainer/submitter ping and no response from maintainer: apply friendly_maintainer_reminder boilerplate (one time only)
  
ELSE:
  - If: 2 weeks since maintainer or submitter comment: apply periodic_reminder
  
THEN:
  - If notabug is left as comment by maintainer: apply notabug boilerplate, close issue.
  - If wontfix is left as comment: apply wontfix boilerplate, close issue.
  - If bug_resolved is left as comment by submitter or maintainer: apply bug_resolved boilerplate, close issue.
  - If resolved_by_PR is left as comment by submitter or maintainer: apply resolved_by_pr boilerplate, close issue.
  
* If at any time a pull request is referenced in the issue (NOTE: This could be optional / future enhancement, but might help people to be more proactive about testing PRs / closing issues.)
  - If pull request was referenced by issue submitter:
    * Apply submitter_PR boilerplate, ping maintainer
  - If pull request was referenced by a maintainer:
    * Apply maintainer_PR boilerplate, ping submitter
  - If pull request was referenced by anyone else:
    * Apply other_PR boilerplate, ping submitter and maintainer
  OR:
    - If all that logic is too hard:
    - If a pull request was referenced by anyone: apply pull_request_created boilerplate

"@maintainer: Pinging you with a friendly reminder that this bug report exists. We know you're human (unlike Ansibullbot!) - but:
1: If you're just seeing this for the first time, and it needs more information, please let the submitter know (using the @ sign with their ID) and any additional questions you might have for the submitter.
2: If you believe this issue has been or will be resolved by an existing pull request, please indicate with a comment saying resolved_by_pr; referencing the 
3: Sometimes life or work can get busy! While we don't need to know all the details, just let us know you're busy for a while in a comment. People understand. (And really: if you're on a vacation, we are super happy for you -- but don't tell us the dates when you'll be out of town. Creepy people on the internet might go to your house and take all your Ansible stickers if they know you're gone.)"

@submitter: If you have any updates, please add them in a comment.

* periodic_reminder:
@maintainer & @submitter: Just giving a friendly reminder that this issue is still open.
If either of you believe this bug is now resolved, please leave a comment stating bug_resolved and we will close the issue. If you know of a PR that has resolved or will resolve this bug, please leave a comment saying resolved_by_PR, and reference the PR # in the comments.
If this bug is now believed to not be a bug, please leave a comment stating notabug. 

@maintainer: If you require more information to make progress on this bug, please let the submitter know by pinging their ID in a comment. If this is a bug you cannot or will not resolve, please leave a comment stating wontfix, along with any reasons why, and we will close this issue. 

We encourage maintainers and submitters (as well as anyone affected) to continue to leave updates or provide additional information or guidance in the comments -- this can help the issue to move towards resolution. 

* pending_action:
"@submitter: Greetings! We previously asked for you to provide more information regarding your issue. Without your input, we can't notify the maintainer, or make progress on your issue. Please provide the information requested within the next two weeks, or we will close the issue for non-responsiveness."

"@submitter: Greetings! Thanks for taking the time to open this issue. In order to handle your issue effectively, we need a bit more information. Please ensure that you have properly selected ONE issue type, and that you have added the module name, spelled correctly, in the appropriate field."
  - OPEN QUESTION: By editing the original issue, or by copying the template into a new comment?
  - OPEN QUESTION: Should a response to please_complete with just the module name be enough response to proceed forward?
